                But habitat loss and fragmentation remain the gravest threats to the survival of the species. A large proportion of the panda's habitat has already been lost: logged for timber and fuel wood, or cleared for agriculture and infrastructure to meet the needs of the area's booming population.</td>

            <td style="font-size: larger;" background="img/bgtable.jpg">The loss and fragmentation of panda habitats disrupt their natural behavior, making it difficult for pandas to find suitable food sources, establish territories, and maintain healthy populations. This disruption also affects their ability to reproduce and interact with other pandas, leading to a decline in their overall population.</i> </td>

Working to sustain the natural world for the benefit of people and nature.However some poaching of pandas still occurs. Hunting the animals for their fur has declined due to strict laws and greater public awareness of the pandas protected status. </td>
